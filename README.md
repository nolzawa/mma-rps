# mma-rps
HTML/Javascript mini RPS game with some multiplayer function.

Personal project for a virtual engagement game where there is two fighters with randomised RPS attacks behind the 3 buttons.
Not rigged and extremely based on luck for extra fun factor.

Some customisation to add fighter's name to replace the default and capability to store score persistently until 'Clear All' is clicked.

New Round - re-randomise RPS values for both players
Clear All - clear everything
